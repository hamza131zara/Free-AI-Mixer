# Known Issues

This file tracks current architecture debt and unstable behaviors that future work must not ignore.

## Stability Issues

### Hydration Runtime Sign-Off

Current state:

- explicit hydration state exists
- interaction is gated until restore completes
- queued scenes sanitize to `idle`
- generating scenes sanitize to `idle` unless valid browser-local resumable provider job metadata exists
- queue dedupe guards were added

Verification recorded:

- hydration/runtime browser sign-off passed
- H01-H10 Playwright matrix passed
- `npm run typecheck` passed
- `npm run build` passed
- `npm run test:e2e` passed
- `npm run verify:phase36` passed

### LocalStorage Limitations

Current state:

- scenes and generated results persist in localStorage

Why it matters:

- large payloads may eventually pressure browser storage
- there is no persistence migration strategy beyond basic versioning

Target fix phase:

- later stabilization work after current foundation phases

### Selector Cache Assumptions

Current state:

- selector stability depends on immutable store updates

Why it matters:

- in-place mutation would break cached selector expectations

Target fix phase:

- ongoing discipline

## Platform Gaps

### No Durable Backend Queue

Current state:

- queue execution is in-memory and browser-bound

Why it matters:

- browser-local resume works only from persisted local state, not from a server-owned durable queue
- concurrency and status are local, not globally durable

Target fix phase:

- later backend/infrastructure work

### No Multi-Device Or Cross-Tab Resume Coordination

Current state:

- browser-local resume works only in the local persisted store for one browser context
- there is no shared lease, coordination, or ownership model across devices or browser contexts

Why it matters:

- multiple clients cannot safely coordinate one remote provider job
- resume guarantees stop at the local browser boundary

Target fix phase:

- later backend/infrastructure work

### No Server Workers Or Webhook Completion

Current state:

- provider polling is browser-driven
- there are no background workers, webhook consumers, or server-authoritative completion handlers

Why it matters:

- work only progresses while a browser runtime owns the polling loop
- the system cannot yet claim durable backend orchestration

Target fix phase:

- later backend/infrastructure work

### No Remote Provider Cancellation

Current state:

- local abort behavior exists only for the browser-owned polling flow
- remote provider cancellation is not implemented

Why it matters:

- canceling browser activity does not imply the upstream provider job is canceled

Target fix phase:

- later backend/infrastructure work

## Verification Gaps

- long-running provider telemetry is not implemented; the UI currently reports app lifecycle stages only

### Timeline Phase 4.4 Boundaries

Current state:

- timeline domain types exist in `src/types/timeline.ts`
- timeline store exists in `src/store/timelineStore.ts` with actions, selectors, and local persistence
- timeline UI shell and scene-source add-flow are implemented
- timeline sequencing/reorder is implemented through store-owned `moveClipUp` / `moveClipDown` and UI Move up/Move down buttons
- focused timeline UI coverage exists in `tests/e2e/phase43-timeline-ui.spec.ts`
- focused timeline store reorder coverage exists in `tests/e2e/phase42-timeline-store.spec.ts`
- drag/drop polish is not implemented yet
- playback runtime/timers are not implemented yet
- video export/backend rendering are not implemented yet
- backend render queue is not implemented yet

Why it matters:

- Phase 4.4 establishes baseline timeline sequencing/reorder only; drag/drop polish and runtime playback/export remain deferred

Target fix phase:

- Phase 4.5 and later timeline/video phases
