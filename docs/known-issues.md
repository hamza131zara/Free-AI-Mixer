# Known Issues

This file tracks current architecture debt and unstable behaviors that future work must not ignore.

## Stability Issues

### Hydration Runtime Sign-Off

Current state:

- explicit hydration state exists
- interaction is gated until restore completes
- queued scenes sanitize to `idle`
- generating scenes sanitize to `idle` unless valid browser-local resumable provider job metadata exists
- queue dedupe guards were added

Verification recorded:

- hydration/runtime browser sign-off passed
- H01-H10 Playwright matrix passed
- `npm run typecheck` passed
- `npm run build` passed
- `npm run test:e2e` passed
- `npm run verify:phase36` passed

### LocalStorage Limitations

Current state:

- scenes and generated results persist in localStorage

Why it matters:

- large payloads may eventually pressure browser storage
- there is no persistence migration strategy beyond basic versioning

Target fix phase:

- later stabilization work after current foundation phases

### Selector Cache Assumptions

Current state:

- selector stability depends on immutable store updates

Why it matters:

- in-place mutation would break cached selector expectations

Target fix phase:

- ongoing discipline

## Platform Gaps

### Export Runtime Still Deferred

Current state:

- export/render job contracts exist in `src/types/exportJob.ts`
- export submit/poll/artifact service contracts exist in `src/services/exportService.ts`
- focused export service contract and edge tests exist in `tests/e2e/phase52-export-service.spec.ts`
- export agent orchestration scaffold exists in `src/agents/exportAgent.ts`
- focused export agent orchestration tests exist in `tests/e2e/phase53-export-agent.spec.ts`
- export store integration exists in `src/store/exportStore.ts`
- focused export store tests exist in `tests/e2e/phase54-export-store.spec.ts`
- export UI/status actions exist in `src/components/TimelineExportPanel.tsx`
- focused export UI tests exist in `tests/e2e/phase55-export-ui.spec.ts`
- actual video export is not implemented
- export runtime integration is not implemented
- auto-resume polling is not implemented for export jobs
- backend render queue is not implemented
- server workers are not implemented
- webhook completion is not implemented
- remote render cancellation is not implemented
- downloadable video output is not implemented
- real video rendering is not implemented
- durable export job persistence is not implemented
- artifact hosting/signed URLs are not implemented
- multi-device export resume coordination is not implemented
- auth/credits/billing are not implemented
- production queue/worker scaling is not implemented
- frontend-to-backend local development integration now exists (Phase 6.3-B), but production-grade export runtime integration remains incomplete
- renderer implementation is not started (Phase 6.5 decision recorded; implementation deferred)

Why it matters:

- Phase 5.2 currently adds service contracts and focused contract tests only, not runtime export capability
- frontend must remain truthful and must not fake completion/progress/artifacts/cancellation
- Phase 6.1 backend scaffold must avoid fake success/progress/artifacts/download claims
- initial backend job registry may be in-memory and local-only before durable persistence phases
- current requestId idempotency is process-local/in-memory only and is not durable across restarts
- local integration support must remain truthful: no fake progress, no fake terminal success, no fake artifacts, and no fake downloadable URLs
- real artifact records must only exist after real files are produced and verified
- export API responses must remain metadata-only (no raw blobs, no local filesystem paths)
- planned renderer lifecycle/worker contracts are documented, but workers/queues/webhooks/database/durable persistence are still deferred
- planned progress policy remains truthful-only (stage milestones only unless renderer can compute real percent)
- backend lifecycle state-machine guards now exist (Phase 6.6-B), but renderer execution and real artifact production are still deferred
- no real artifact URLs/download outputs exist; artifact hosting/signing remains deferred
- backend artifact metadata contract now exists (Phase 6.7-B), but it is structural-only and does not imply real artifact files
- worker-boundary claim ownership contract now exists (Phase 6.8-B), but no real worker runtime/queue/renderer execution exists yet
- Phase 6.9-A readiness audit confirms foundation readiness for Phase 7 planning, but renderer runtime and real artifact production remain deferred
- renderer input snapshot contract exists (Phase 7.0-B), but it is backend-internal contract validation only and does not imply renderer execution or file output
- temp/output path policy helper exists (Phase 7.1-B), but no file generation or directory creation runtime exists yet
- real file verification helper exists (Phase 7.2-B), but no renderer execution, production file generation pipeline, artifact hosting/signing, or download output exists yet
- renderer failure mapping helper exists (Phase 7.3-B), but it is mapping/sanitization only; no renderer runtime, lifecycle mutation, artifact output, or download capability exists yet

Target fix phase:

- later backend/export phases

### No Durable Backend Queue

Current state:

- queue execution is in-memory and browser-bound

Why it matters:

- browser-local resume works only from persisted local state, not from a server-owned durable queue
- concurrency and status are local, not globally durable

Target fix phase:

- later backend/infrastructure work

### No Multi-Device Or Cross-Tab Resume Coordination

Current state:

- browser-local resume works only in the local persisted store for one browser context
- there is no shared lease, coordination, or ownership model across devices or browser contexts

Why it matters:

- multiple clients cannot safely coordinate one remote provider job
- resume guarantees stop at the local browser boundary

Target fix phase:

- later backend/infrastructure work

### No Server Workers Or Webhook Completion

Current state:

- provider polling is browser-driven
- there are no background workers, webhook consumers, or server-authoritative completion handlers

Why it matters:

- work only progresses while a browser runtime owns the polling loop
- the system cannot yet claim durable backend orchestration

Target fix phase:

- later backend/infrastructure work

### No Remote Provider Cancellation

Current state:

- local abort behavior exists only for the browser-owned polling flow
- remote provider cancellation is not implemented

Why it matters:

- canceling browser activity does not imply the upstream provider job is canceled

Target fix phase:

- later backend/infrastructure work

## Verification Gaps

- long-running provider telemetry is not implemented; the UI currently reports app lifecycle stages only

### Timeline Phase 4.5 Boundaries

Current state:

- timeline domain types exist in `src/types/timeline.ts`
- timeline store exists in `src/store/timelineStore.ts` with actions, selectors, and local persistence
- timeline UI shell and scene-source add-flow are implemented
- timeline sequencing/reorder is implemented through store-owned `moveClipUp` / `moveClipDown` and UI Move up/Move down buttons
- timeline manual playback simulation is implemented through store-owned playback actions/selectors and UI playback controls
- focused timeline UI coverage exists in `tests/e2e/phase43-timeline-ui.spec.ts`
- focused timeline store reorder coverage exists in `tests/e2e/phase42-timeline-store.spec.ts`
- drag/drop polish is not implemented yet
- automatic playback loop/timers are not implemented yet
- real media/video playback is not implemented yet
- video export/backend rendering are not implemented yet
- backend render queue is not implemented yet
- server workers for export orchestration are not implemented yet
- webhook completion for export jobs is not implemented yet
- remote render cancellation is not implemented yet
- downloadable video output is not implemented yet

Why it matters:

- Phase 4.5 establishes baseline manual playback simulation only; automatic playback loop/timers, real media playback, and playback/export runtime behavior remain deferred

Target fix phase:

- Phase 4.6 and later timeline/video phases
